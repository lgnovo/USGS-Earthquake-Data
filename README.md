# USGS-Earthquake-Data

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. The code for his project utilizes real-time data from USGS's website https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php on all earthquakes from the past 7 days (updated every minute.)
